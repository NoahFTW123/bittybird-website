            <p className="about-text">
                In a cozy corner of Waxhaw, North Carolina, where the scent of freshly baked treats mingles with the hum
                of a laser engraver, you&apos;ll find heather (with a little ”h”)—a spirited mom of six rowdy, wonderful sons
                and the magic-maker (along with tech support husband David) behind Bittybird & Co. With hands that
                juggle motherhood and creativity in equal measure, she transforms everyday objects into treasured
                keepsakes, etching stories, laughter, and a sprinkle of enchantment into every piece.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
                Her world is a delightful tapestry of whimsy and wonder. She stitches love into quilts, captures
                fleeting moments through her camera lens, and collects little bits of joy wherever she goes. She dances
                between batches of her chocolate chip toffee cookies and making batches of sweet smelling soap. With a
                heart full of gnomes, cats, and all things charmingly peculiar, she finds joy in the simple things—like
                the crunch of a perfect pickle or the bliss of a stolen afternoon nap.

                At Bittybird & Co., every engraving tells a tale, every design is infused with a touch of her playful
                spirit, and every creation carries a whisper of warmth from a home filled with laughter, love, and a
                little bit of beautiful chaos.
